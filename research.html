        <h2>Dietary Intervention Study Using Mouse Models</h2>
        <p>In this study, I contributed to the computational analysis of metagenomic data from dietary intervention experiments using human-to-mouse microbiota transplants. Mice received fecal microbiota from humans on high- or low-fiber diets. Combining metabolomics and ex vivo mucus function assays, the study showed that increased fiber intake enriches <em>Blautia</em>, and specifically <em>B. coccoides</em>, which enhances mucus function via SCFA production and activation of the Ffar2 receptor.</p>

        <h2>Uncovering the Global Diversity and Functional Roles of Prevotella in the Human Gut Microbiome</h2>
        <p>I conducted a comprehensive analysis of <em>Prevotella</em> species in the global human gut microbiome using publicly available metagenomic datasets from both healthy individuals and those with IBD. This included a large Indian cohort of 200 individuals consuming plant-based diets, which showed the highest <em>Prevotella</em> abundance among all populations analyzed.</p>

        <p>To support this study, I developed a <strong>Prevotella Genome Database</strong> comprising 2,204 genomes/MAGs—including five newly isolated <em>P. copri</em> strains from India—and a gene catalogue with 2.9 million genes. My analysis revealed extensive unexplored diversity of <em>P. copri</em> in non-Western populations, enriched in genes for degrading complex plant polysaccharides (e.g., xylan, pectin, hemicellulose), suggesting a beneficial dietary adaptation.</p>

        <p>In contrast, Western populations showed greater abundance of <em>Prevotella</em> species linked to oral inflammation, along with virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes, indicating potential pathobiont roles and a mouth-gut axis. This is one of the first <em>Prevotella</em>-focused studies on the Indian gut microbiome, offering novel insights into its population-specific roles in health and disease.</p>

        <h2>Smokeless Tobacco-Associated Dysbiosis in the Oral Microbiome and Its Link to Oral Cancer</h2>
        <p>I conducted the complete analysis for this study, which provides key insights into the impact of smokeless tobacco on the oral microbiome and its potential role in oral cancer. The findings reveal a significant shift in microbial composition in tobacco users, even among healthy individuals, suggesting a transition toward an inflammation-associated microbiome.</p>

        <p>A clear gradient was observed—from healthy, to smokeless tobacco users, to OSCC (oral squamous cell carcinoma) patients—indicating a progressive dysbiosis. This pattern aligns with the “Anna Karenina principle,” where microbiomes in disease states become more variable and individualized.</p>

        <p><em>Streptococcus</em> was consistently enriched in healthy samples and validated across independent OSCC cohorts, supporting its role as a marker of oral health. These results highlight smokeless tobacco as a potential driver of microbial dysbiosis and oral cancer risk.</p>
